# DineSafe
Dinesafe is a full-stack application that allows users to record allergies that they have experienced at restaurants so that themselves as well as other users can be wary of these items. A lot of restaurants don't put these allergies on their menu and waitresses/waiters 
are also often unaware about potentially harmful items.

## How it was built:
### Technologies
Frontend: React, Redux, Typescript, Tailwind CSS
Backend: AWS (Lambda, APIGateway, S3, IAM), Golang
Database: AWS RDS (MySQL)
Other Tools: AWS (Route53, Cloudformation, Cloudwatch, Codebuild, Codepipeline)
